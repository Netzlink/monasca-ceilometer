Python plugin code for Ceilometer to send samples to monasca-api

### Installation Instructions

Assumes that an active monasca-api server is running.

1. Run devstack to get openstack installed.  monasca-ceilometer was developed on a Ubuntu 12.04 host.

2.  Clone python-monascaclient from github.com.
    
      Copy python-monascaclient to the following path:

        /opt/stack/ceilometer/ceilometer/monclient

3.  Clone monasca-ceilometer from github.com.

      Copy monclient.py to the following path:
  
        /opt/stack/ceilometer/ceilometer/publisher/monclient.py

4.  Edit entry_points.txt

      Under [ceilometer.publisher] section add the following line:

        monclient = ceilometer.publisher.monclient:monclient


5.  Edit setup.cfg

      Under 'ceilometer.publisher =' section add the following line:

        monclient = ceilometer.publisher.monclient:monclient

6.  Configure /etc/ceilometer/pipeline.yaml to send the metrics to the monclient publisher.  Use the included pipeline.yaml file as an example.

7.  Setup debugging.

    * Create a pycharm run configuration.
  
        - Script: /usr/local/bin/ceilometer-api
        - Script parameters:  -d -v --log-dir=/var/log/ceilometer-api --config-file /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf
    
    * Comment out any logging messages that cause the debugger to lose the debugging session.
    * Make sure that 'Attach to subprocess automatically while debugging' is checked in Pycharm's Python Debugger settings.
    * Make sure that 'Gevent compatible debugging' is checked in Pycharm's Debugger settings.
  
  
### Todo

1. Modify monclient.py to not hard-code kwargs sent to client.Client.
